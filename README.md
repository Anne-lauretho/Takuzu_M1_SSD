# Takuzu_M1_SSD 

Welcome to our project for the HAX815X course for the academic year 2024-2025.
Our project is titled **Takuzu_M1_SSD**.\
The team members are :
- AIGOIN Emilie
- THOMAS Anne-Laure

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a library in the R language, including an interactive Shiny application for the game Takuzu (a variant of Binairo).

## Introduction to Takuzu (Binairo)
Takuzu, also known as Binairo, is a combinatorial logic game played on a square grid, usually of size 6 × 6 or 8 × 8. It follows strict rules that are reminiscent of Sudoku and other logic placement games.

### Game Rules
- Each cell in the grid must be filled with either a 0 or a 1.
- Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.
- It is forbidden to have three consecutive 0s or three consecutive 1s in a row or column.
- Two identical rows or two identical columns are not allowed in the same grid.

### Strategies for Solving a Takuzu
- **Avoiding Triples**: If two 0s or two 1s are consecutive, the next cell must contain the other digit.
- **Balancing 0s and 1s**: A row or column cannot contain more than half of its cells with the same digit.
- **Comparing Completed Rows and Columns**: If a row or column is almost filled and another is similar, adjust the digits to avoid duplicates.

Takuzu is an accessible game but becomes increasingly complex as the grid size increases.
